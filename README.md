`bluectl` is the official command line interface for Alphaus services.

To install using [brew](https://brew.sh/), run the following command:

```bash
$ brew tap alphauslabs/tap # only once
$ brew install bluectl
```

To setup the environment variables required for authentication, check out [blue-sdk-go](https://github.com/alphauslabs/blue-sdk-go).

You can also use the `--client-id` and `--client-secret` flags to set the values explicitly.

Run `bluectl -h` or `bluectl <subcommand> -h` to know more about the available subcommands and flags.
